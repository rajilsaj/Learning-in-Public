## Personal Reflection  

> *"I am facing impostor syndrome. I don’t feel fully ready yet. With graduation coming in 2026, it’s already time to apply for Summer 2026 internships and prepare for my first job after graduation, but I want to try something different — maybe even a little crazy. I want to dedicate one full semester to sharpening myself, filling the gaps in my resume, and building real confidence in all the things I supposedly know. Like a samurai who spends his life sharpening his blade for the day of battle, I want to prepare with discipline and focus, so when my time comes, I will stand ready."*  -->
